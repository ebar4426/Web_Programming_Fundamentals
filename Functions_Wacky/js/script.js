var wordCalc = function(wordsPMin, hoursTypeEssay, averageNumOfLetters){
	var min = 60;
	var total = wordsPMin * min * hoursTypeEssay;//how to get the total per hour your typing and find out how much you would type if you typed an essay
	var strokes = total * averageNumOfLetters;//please enter the average number of leters of the words your using in your essay
